## Introduction

I owe huge credit to Cathy Schlund-Vials, Linda Trinh VÃµ, and K. Scott Wong's *Keywords for Asian American Studies* for introducing me to Asian American Studies. Their anthology of Asian American diasporic ideas accompanied *Keywords for American Cultural Studies*, *Keywords for African American Studies*, *Keywords for Environmental Studies*, and a few other anthologies, all published by the NYU Press in an expansive project begun in 2011. These beautiful collections of esssays act as explorations of key concepts for each of these fields, offering insight into the history of the word and how it has been deployed. Many words are contained only in a single collection, but many (like *race*, in [African American Studies](https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/essay/race/), [Asian American Studies](https://keywords.nyupress.org/asian-american-studies/essay/race/), [Latina/o American Studies](https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/essay/race/), and so on) contain definitions in multiple places to illustrate their power in a different context. In this manner, the collection crosses boundaries between different fields of study without giving up all of the complexity each subfield provides, and at once crosses the boundary between subject and observer by exploring how the words have been given meaning by material reality and discourse together.

For me, as a student, these essays lend greatly-needed practical clarity on formerly-vaguely-defined buzzwords like "neoliberalism" and "cosmopolitanism." But they also lend me insight into the structure of knowledge and study as overarching concepts. How we have come to understand and reunderstand justice, liberty, labor, class, race, and everything else depends on reflective and critical work, and it is only through collections like *Keywords* that I have been able to realize this. 

My own *Keywords* series of blog posts are centered around concepts I find myself returning to continuously. My understanding of these concepts shape how I understand self, history, and reality. In sharing these thoughts, I hope to provide insight into both my own subject-self and the personal intimacy these concepts convey.
