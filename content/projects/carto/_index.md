Maps can reinforce what we already know, maps can tell us what we do not know. Making and critiquing maps can tell us how we know what we know, and contextualizing this within the historical context producing maps can tell us how maps service certain political goals. Maybe most importantly, maps are also *so* pleasing to look at. 

This section represents my own mapmaking projects, or my attempts to expand and critique how I know certain spaces by representing them through maps.
