<h2>Nathan Kim</h2>
<p>I’m a junior at Yale College double majoring in Ethnicity, Race, &amp; Migration and Statistics &amp; Data Science. I am broadly interested in a critical study of space and race, especially in how actions along these dimensions can destroy or advance global imperialism.</p>
<p>I have related interests in data visualization and interactive presentations. My strengths are in the R tidyverse, and I am also familiar with the data.table, Shiny, sf, and spatstat packages. I also have experience working in Python, Stata, Tableau, and Excel.</p>
