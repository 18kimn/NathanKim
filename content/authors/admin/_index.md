I'm a junior at Yale College double majoring in Ethnicity, Race, & Migration and Statistics & Data Science. I am broadly interested in a critical study of space and race, especially in how actions along these dimensions can destroy or advance global imperialism. I have related interests in data visualization and interactive presentations. My strengths are in the R tidyverse, and I am also familiar with the data.table, Shiny, sf, and spatstat packages. I also have experience working in Python, Stata, Tableau, and Excel. 

I work as a research assistant with Professor Emma Zang through the Yale Institution for Social and Policy Studies, and with Dr. Paul Joudrey at the Yale School of Medicine. I am also an intern with local New Haven nonprofit DataHaven. On campus, I am part of the Asian Students for Ethnic Studies group (formerly the Asian American Studies Task Force) and perform with Korean drum troup UNITY. Previously, I served as Programming Chair for the Asian American Students Alliance and was a Dwight Hall Urban Fellow, through which I worked at local nonprofit LEAP. 

You can find more informaiton in my [CV](files/cv.pdf), and some of my work in the [Projects](#projects) tab.
